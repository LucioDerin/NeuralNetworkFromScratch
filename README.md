Implementation of a Neural Network from scratch with `python`, including forward and backward propagation, following the book "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python, Harrison Kinsley & Daniel KukieÅ‚a".

The motivation behind this project is perfectly expressed by R. Feynmann's famous quote: 
>"What I cannot create, I do not understand"
